## Price elasticity

Here we did some more fiddly analysis and wanted to use matplotlib for whatever reason,
no problemâ€”it's exactly the same thing (except that these aren't interactive, just images):

<pre>
{%- raw %}
{{ figure("elasticity_vs_profit") }}
{% endraw -%}
</pre>

{{ figure("elasticity_vs_profit") }}
