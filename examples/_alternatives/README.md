# Reports from markdown + python with existing tools

It's useful to consider our alternatives before rolling our own ([bored-charts](https://www.github.com/oliverlambson/bored-charts)).

We can achieve markdown with python charts -> pdf via pandoc and nbconvert:

1. Convert markdown to jupyter notebook with pandoc
2. Execute the notebook and output it to pdf with nbconvert

Two examples are provided: (1) a full example with separated python analysis and execution of
them in markdown code cells, and (2) a minimal example with inline python code. (I really
don't like the inline codeâ€”at that point all we've done is make a worse jupyter notebook.
Remember, the point of this is to actually do our analysis as code so that it's separate, clear, and maybe even tested.)

## Running the examples

You're going to need [uv](<(https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)>) and
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed.

```sh
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
source .venv/bin/activate
./build.sh examples/full/main.md # or ./build.sh examples/minimal/main.md
```

1. We could use voila for live reports, but at that point we've gone fully square peg in round hole.
2. I think this is a pro.
